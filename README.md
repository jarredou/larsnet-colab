# Deep Drums Demixing ü•Å

We introduce StemGMD, a large-scale audio dataset of isolated single-instrument drum stems. Each audio clip is synthesized from MIDI recordings of expressive drums performances using ten real-sounding acoustic drum kits. Totaling 1224 hours, StemGMD is the largest audio dataset of drums to date and the first to comprise isolated audio clips for every instrument in a canonical nine-piece drum kit.
We leverage StemGMD to develop and release LarsNet, a novel deep drum source separation model. Using a parallel arrangement of dedicated U-Nets, LarsNet can separate five stems from a stereo drum mixture faster than real-time and is shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art spectro-temporal factorization methods.

* Audio examples are available on our [GitHub page](https://polimi-ispl.github.io/larsnet/)

* StemGMD is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7860223)
